# Developer Runtime System Spec

## 1. What This Is (one line)

**A developer-first runtime system that exposes thinking, decisions, and credibility through controlled discovery — not a portfolio website.**

If anything you build doesn’t support this sentence → delete it.

---

## 2. Core Laws (non-negotiable)

- ❌ No pages-first thinking
- ❌ No scroll-driven experience
- ❌ No “About / Skills / Projects” sections
- ❌ No marketing tone
- ❌ No visual trends
- ✅ State-driven system
- ✅ Modules > pages
- ✅ Discovery over presentation
- ✅ Silence is intentional
- ✅ Senior dev respect > mass appeal

---

## 3. User Model (locked)

### States (implicit)

- Observer → Explorer → Inspector → Evaluator → Connector

### Modes (explicit)

- Overview → Deep → Signal

System adapts to behavior, not roles.

---

## 4. Information Discovery (locked)

- Tier 1: Immediate signals (quiet, minimal)
- Tier 2: Discoverable depth (intentional)
- Tier 3: Inspector-only (tradeoffs, failures, edge cases)

No forced discovery.
No duplicate info across tiers.

---

## 5. Navigation & Movement (locked)

Only 3 movement types:

- Context Shift (module change)
- Drill Down (depth)
- Lateral Shift (comparison)

Scrolling ≠ navigation.

---

## 6. Motion & Visual Language (locked)

- Motion explains change, never decorates
- Predictable easing
- Engineered timing
- Visual silence > decoration
- Typography = infrastructure

If it “looks cool” before it “feels calm” → wrong.

---

## 7. Content Voice (locked)

- Neutral
- Declarative
- No hype
- No “I am passionate”
- No motivational language

Text reads like:

> documentation + system logs + postmortems

---

## 8. Data & Signals (locked)

Signal hierarchy:

- Foundational (always present, quiet)
- Validation (external proof)
- Intelligence (thinking, tradeoffs)

Visitor count = runtime invocation signal
- ❌ not social proof
- ❌ not animated
- ❌ not highlighted

---

## 9. Failure Strategy (locked)

Failure is:

- contextual
- opt-in
- unemotional

Only visible to Inspectors / Evaluators.

This is a trust engine.

---

## 10. UI Zones (locked structure)

There are 5 zones only:

1. System Bar – runtime signals, mode
2. Context Pane – module switching (not menu)
3. Active Surface – one concept at a time
4. Inspector Drawer – deep technical content
5. Exit Surface – quiet connection endpoint

No extra zones.
No exceptions.

---

## 11. Modules (locked)

- Identity Graph (not bio)
- Systems Built (core credibility)
- Capability Matrix (not skills list)
- Experimental / R&D
- Signals (validation, hidden by default)

Old portfolio content is fully mapped into these.
Nothing is wasted.

---

## 12. Tech Architecture (locked)

### Stack (approved)

- React + TypeScript
- Zustand (state)
- Tailwind (strict discipline)
- Framer Motion (restricted)
- Minimal routing
- Serverless endpoint (visitor count)
- Vercel / Netlify

### Explicitly avoided

- Over-engineering
- Heavy CMS
- WebGL gimmicks
- Animation engines
- Microservice nonsense

---

## 13. Build Order (locked)

1. State model & navigation logic
2. Discovery & signal rules
3. Motion for state change
4. Visual language
5. Signal mode polish

If you skip Layer 1 → system collapses.
