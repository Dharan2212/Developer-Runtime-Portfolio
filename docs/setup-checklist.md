# Setup Checklist

This checklist is the starting point for building the developer runtime system without friction.

## ✅ 1. Repo & Project Setup

Owner confirmation: setup is complete. Use this section as a record of what is already done.

- [x] Confirm repo root is clean and tracked.
- [x] Create a React + TypeScript app scaffold (preferred: Vite). (Done manually in VS Code.)
- [x] Establish Tailwind config with strict utility usage (no ad-hoc CSS).
- [x] Install Zustand for state model and Framer Motion for constrained motion.
- [x] Configure a minimal routing strategy (single surface, state-driven).
- [x] Add a serverless endpoint for visitor count (runtime invocation signal).
- [x] Add formatting and lint rules focused on consistency (no style noise).
- [x] Document the state model and module map before UI work begins.
